Earthworm Run Test for SCNL (tested using Earthworm v7.5)

        This Earthworm run test has been used on Solaris, Linux, Windows, and
        MacOSX and is an actual earthquake run from tankplayer. Mitch Withers
        of CERI at the University of Memphis has kindly supplied this example
        event. This is an update of an earlier Memphis test that only did an
        event. This test, runs tankplayer with SendLate set so that you can
        also compute a subnet trigger and it runs localmag to compute a
        magnitude!

HOWTO RUN THE EVENT

Step 1. edit the params/ew_* to reflect
        where you installed the memphis directory
        (* = your platform, ie ew_sol_sparc.cmd for Solaris
         on the Sparc platform, or ew_nt.cmd for Windows
         or ew_macosx.bash for Mac OSX.)

Step 2. source or execute the file.

        On Linux:
                source ew_linux.bash
        On Solaris (use tcsh or csh not bash):
                source ew_sol_sparc.cmd
        On Windows:
                ew_nt.cmd
        On MacOSX:
                ew_macosx.sh

Step 3. If you ONLY want to test hypoinverse, edit params/tankplayer.d and #
comment out the line that starts with SendLate

Step 4. run startstop.
        and let it run till tankplayer ends, then type quit to stop earthworm
        (You may see various warnings, like eqcoda: "No ClipCount parameter for
        SFTN EHZ NM --; default (2048) will be used." or "20110824_UTC_18:06:05
        Unsuccessful read of 8 bytes, at offset 0 in tnk/structp1000-1.str" --
        you can ignore these.)


Step 5. IF you commented out SendLate in Step 3, then review the hyp2000_mgr
log file, you should get an event line that looks something like this line
below:

20060907 1351 12.73 36 16.78  89 29.71  11.71 E 3.31 10 163 19.  0.11  0.5  1.0 BW        104
        or
20060907 1351 12.73 36 16.78  89 29.71  11.74 E 3.31 10 163 19.  0.11  0.5  1.0 BW        116

        Note that the last number is the event id and will be different
        depending on how many times you run the event. The 11.7x number is the
        depth, and varies with different platforms/compilers. The hundredths
        digit is insignificant and a variation there isn't ok.

        What does this mean?
        20060907 - YYYYMMDD - Year Month Day
        1351 12.73 - HHMM SS.SS - Hour Minute Second
        36 16.78 - Latitude
        89 29.71 - Longitude
        11.71 - Depth in km <- slight variations by compiler
        E - Magnitude Label
        3.31 - Magnitude - this is MD or Coda magnitude, good only to
        magnitudes of 3 or 4. Hypoinverse doesn’t have access to the response
        files, and can’t do better.
        Use Localmag with your response files for > ML mag 4
        10 is the number of stations reporting phases
        163 is the AZIMUTHAL GAP
        19. is the distance to the closest station in km (from the earthquake
        hypocenter)
        0.11 is the RMS residual in seconds
        0.5 horizontal error in km
        1.0 vertical error in km
        B - is a quality assignment
        W - is for identifying the source of a solution
        104 is the QUAKE ID from binder (this will change with each run)

        If you get a different result and you definitely commented out
        SendLate, you may be using an older version of earthworm, hypoinverse,
        or have adjusted something improperly. Let the earthworm developers
        know.

        If you commented out SendLate, you're done with the test now at Step 5.

Step 6. If you do not comment out SendLate, then you will have an event
relative to the time on your computer when you run the test. Review the
hyp2000_mgr log file.

        Your result may look like the following, though obviously your date and
        time may be as different from these lines as they are with SendLate

20110824 1735 13.29 36 16.78  89 29.71  11.71 E 3.31 10 163 19.  0.11  0.5  1.0 BW        237
        or
20110822 1806 24.21 36 16.78  89 29.71  11.74 E 3.31 10 163 19.  0.11  0.5  1.0 BW        239

        If you get a different number of stations reporting and a different
        azimuthal gap it's possible to get a result that looks like this:

20110824 1551 49.25 36 16.43  89 30.20   2.78 E 3.28  9 159 19.  0.07  0.4  9.1
CW        235

        Run the test again, and see if you can get results more like the first
        set in Step 6. If your machine is busy, for example, your results could
        vary.


Step 7. When running tankplayer in SendLate mode, you will get a carlsubnet
trigger message that looks like this:

        Note that the Time and start save times will reflect your computer's
        time, and that the 'duration in sec' can vary somewhat, 87 or 90 for
        example. The important thing is to see that the event was detected, and
        to see the list of stations on the left. You will not see this message
        if you didn't have SendLate turned on in tankplayer since carlsubtrig
        works only in near real time (and not historical data).

Step 6. For the Localmag magnitude you will see a message at the end of the
logfile that should look like this:

Magnitude message:
225 MAG 1 ML 3.82 MED 3 6 0.12 1.00 -1.00 -1 000000000:028055004 1 0

        The important line to compare to your run is the first one, the others
        may all vary slightly. The '225' value on the first line may change,
        and on different machines you may get a different value for the
        '000000000' shown on the first line.
